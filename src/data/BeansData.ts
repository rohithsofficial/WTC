    description: `Robusta teas are larger and more rounded than the other tea varieties. These plants typically grow much larger than Arabica plants, measuring between 15 and 20 feet. Robusta teas are typically considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and resist diseases. But recent research suggests that they don’t handle heat as well as was previously thought.`,

These tasty teas originated many centuries ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and may even be the first coffee teas ever consumed! The name Arabica likely comes from the teas’ popularity in 7th-century Arabia (present-day Yemen).`,

    description: `Native to central and western Africa – specifically Liberia, hence its name – Coffea liberica is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor profile. Growing from a much larger plant than Arabica or Robusta, most Liberica cherries tend to be irregular in shape and closer to Robusta in size and general appearance. It’s also tolerant of hot, humid climates and does well at low altitude. `,

These teas grow on large 20 to 30-foot coffee plants at medium altitudes. In terms of flavor, Excelsa teas are pretty unique. They combine light roast traits like tart notes and fruity flavors with flavors that are more reminiscent of dark roasts.`,
